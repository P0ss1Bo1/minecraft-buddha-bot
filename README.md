### Buddha Bot

> The intelligent interactive boosting companion

Buddha Bot was made for a niche minecraft game mode called "two player parkour". See [For Users](##For Users) for a guide that explains how to use the bot for this game.

The code has also been written in such a way that new commands can be added very easily to create your own custom bot. See [For Developers](##For Developers) for an setup guide and how to customize the bot.
